# Basic-Sentiment-Analysis-with-TensorFlow
Basic Sentiment Analysis with TensorFlow Neural Network Project

In this project, you will learn the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and you will learn to use it to solve a basic sentiment analysis problem. By the end of this long project, you will have created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that, after the training, will be able to predict movie reviews as either positive or negative reviews - classifying the sentiment of the review text.
